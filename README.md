### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am working on Explainability, Self-supervision, Generative modeling, and Network optimization for image/video understanding, network training stability, adversarial attacks/defenses, domain generalization, and privacy-preserving.
- ðŸŒ± You are welcome to explore my research work along with the provided code below. Six of the papers are accepted as Oral/Spotlight at ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, BMVC, and ACCV.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: muz.pak@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am really into fitness and thinking to join GYM for quite some time now.
